                You leapt from crumbling bridges
                Watching cityscapes turn to dust
                Filming helicopters crashing
                In the ocean from way above
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                You've been locked in here forever
                And you just can't say goodbye
                Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
                Wrapped in your arms
                You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
                Left in the dark
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                You've been locked in here forever
                And you just can't say goodbye
                Your lips, my lips
                Apocalypse
                Your lips, my lips
                Apocalypse
                Go and sneak us through the rivers
                Flood is rising up on your knees
                Oh, please
                Come out and haunt me
                I know you want me
                Come out and haunt me
                Sharing all your secrets with each other
                Since you were kids
                Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
                Clutched in your fist
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                Got the music in you, baby
                Tell me why
                You've been locked in here forever
                And you just can't say goodbye
                You've been locked in here forever
                And you just can't say goodbye
                Ooh, oh
                When you're all alone
                I'll reach for you
                When you're feelin' low
                I'll be there too
