                <pre>
                    [Verse 1]
                    You leapt from crumbling bridges
                    Watching cityscapes turn to dust
                    Filming helicopters crashing
                    In the ocean from way above

                    [Chorus]
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    You've been locked in here forever
                    And you just can't say goodbye

                    [Verse 2]
                    Kisses on the foreheads of the lovers
                    Wrapped in your arms
                    You've been hiding them in hollowed out pianos
                    Left in the dark

                    [Chorus]
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    You've been locked in here forever
                    And you just can't say goodbye

                    [Bridge]
                    Your lips, my lips
                    Apocalypse
                    Your lips, my lips
                    Apocalypse
                    Go and sneak us through the rivers
                    Flood is rising up on your knees
                    Oh, please
                    Come out and haunt me
                    I know you want me
                    Come out and haunt me

                    [Verse 3]
                    Sharing all your secrets with each other
                    Since you were kids
                    Sleeping soundly with the locket that she gave you
                    Clutched in your fist

                    [Chorus]
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    Got the music in you, baby
                    Tell me why
                    You've been locked in here forever
                    And you just can't say goodbye
                    You've been locked in here forever
                    And you just can't say goodbye

                    [Outro]
                    Ooh, oh
                    When you're all alone
                    I'll reach for you
                    When you're feelin' low
                    I'll be there too
                </pre>
